Case Study: As a front-end developer, I undertook the challenge of converting a complex Figma design into a fully operational and responsive webpage.

Objective: The main goal was to accurately transform the visual elements and interactive features of the Figma design into a responsive webpage, ensuring precise alignment with the original design and smooth adaptability across different screen sizes and devices.

Technology Stack: This project leveraged Next.js and TailwindCSS to faithfully recreate the Figma design.
